# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 overview
For our fourth year project we will develop a First programming Language using Java cc. Our programming Language will be accessible through a web app, we plan on developing a debugger for our language that will allow the user to set breakpoints , resume step-over , step-into and step-out.
The design of our web-app is influenced by https://repl.it/languages/python3. 
The goal of our project is to provide a Novice with a programming language that will allow him to learn programming concepts and by learning it being able to transition to a more advanced language.
Our project will break down the syntax and semantics of python java and c++ and combine them into an easy to access, easy to use programming language. In 1999 Guido van Rossum defined his goals for python.

* an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;
* open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;
* code that is as understandable as plain English;
* suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times. 


He was able to accomplish these goals and take python to the top of the rankings. Python is a great programming languages but its simplicity and plain english style hinders the ability of a programmer to transition to other languages, Python has eliminated many programming concepts that are used in desirable programming such as java and c++.
In java you must declare the type of data this is called static typing (int  x=1 ) on the other hand Python code is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need to declare the type of variable this is known as duck typing 
"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"  (a=1).
This should not be an issue if a software engineer sticks to python for the rest of his life but as we learnt from first year a good software engineer is flexible and must have a love for learning and curiosity. with the market moving towards full stack development developers must be flexible and have a deep understanding of several programming languages. 
  
Principles of a programing language. 
According to (C.A.R.Hoare paper “HINTS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGN” from Stanford University )
A programming language is regarded as a  tool to aid the programmer , Meaning it should give assistance in the most difficult aspects of his Art , Namely program design,
