> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.
The area we would be covering in this project would be compilers. 
As we are creating a new programming language we would also be covering making an editor and a debugger.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.
Our project will be a "First Programming Language". This means that the language we propose to make would be
for users with no previous programming knowledge. Knowing this we plan to survey educators who are used to
teaching programming to get insight into the features that would be useful to implement. With this language 
the users would be able to practise the basic concepts of programming using the editor and debugger built 
by us.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?
The idea came from taking David Sinclair's module CA4003 Compiler Construction. While searching through 
David Sinclair's Undergraduate Project Ideas on his DCU website we came upon "A First Programming Language".
While discussing the idea with David Sinclair for our project we concluded that we would want the users of
this language to be secondary school students.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?
The project will provide an easy to use environment for secondary school students to ease themselves into
writing code and to learn the basic concepts. This would serve as a stepping stone to more complex languages.

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?
It will be useful for secondary school students or any student that would want to learn the basics of programming
in an easy to use language. 


### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.
The languages involved in this project are C++, JAVACC and JAVA

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.
We plan to use javacc to create the programming language. Javacc will allow us to build the compiler needed to create our
new programming language. We plan to use C++ to build our debugger for our new language. 

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.
There will not be any hardware required for this project.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.
The main challenges would be to create a programming language as neither of us have done this before using the javacc language.
Another challenge would be to create a debugger in C++ which we both have a limited ability in. 

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
