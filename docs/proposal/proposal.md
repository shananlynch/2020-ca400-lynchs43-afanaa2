### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.
The area we would be covering in this project would be compilers and Programing languages.
As we are creating a new programming language we would also be making a debugger, 
our programing language will be mainly aimed at beginner programmers.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.
Our project will be a "First Programming Language". This means that the language we propose to make would be
for users with no previous programming knowledge. Knowing this we plan to survey educators who are used to
teaching programming to get insight into the features that would be useful to implement. With this language 
the users would be able to practise the basic concepts of programming using the editor and debugger built 
by us.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?
The idea came from taking David Sinclair's module CA4003 Compiler Construction. While searching through 
David Sinclair's Undergraduate Project Ideas on his DCU website we came upon "A First Programming Language".
While discussing the idea with David Sinclair for our project we concluded that we would want the users of
this language to be programing begginerd, our programing language will have simple understandable syntax and our debugger
will have precise error codes.
We plan on having these features in our debugger Resume ,Step-over ,Step-into , Step-out.
We would like to have a web-app where our users could run and debug code.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?
The project will provide an easy to use web-app for begginer programmer to ease themselves into
writing code and to learn the basic concepts. This would serve as a stepping stone to more complex languages.

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?
It will be useful for beginner programmers that want an easy understandable language to begin their programming journey.
Through our personal experiences learning programming languages from the beginning. We found ourselves falling over certain hurdles.
These hurdles would include the mathematical language used in the syntax. We would hope this language would feel more accessible
to people with little computing knowledge. 


### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.
The languages involved in this project are JAVACC JAVA, GOLANG or RUST ,JAVA SCRIPT and ANGULAR

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.
We plan to use javacc to create the programming language. Javacc will allow us to build the compiler needed to create our
new programming language. We plan to use GOLANG or RUST to build our debugger for our new language. 

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.
There will not be any hardware required for this project.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

1. Creating and designing our grammar for our programming language.
2. Connecting the front end with the back end for with the api contracts
3. Designing and implementing a debugger using Golang or Rust
4. Creating a Web Application using javascript and AngularJS
5. Integrating the linux virtual machine in our server


### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
> The main tasks for this project would be designing the programming language, the back end server with the linux virtual machine
and the front end with the online editor and the debugger. 
>

#### Student 1

> *Student 1 should complete this section.*
> Student 1 will be tasked with doing the back end of the web app and a collaboration with student number 2 on the design and the
making of the programming language

#### Student 2

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*
> Student 2 will be tasked with doing the front end of the web app and a collaboration with student number 1 on the design and the
making of the programming language
